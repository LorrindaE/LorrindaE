- 👋 Hi, I’m @LorrindaE!
- 👀 I’m interested in data, analyzing data, learning how to manipulate data... I've learned some Python, Tableau, Excel, Pandas...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, just started a bootcamp.
- 💞️ I’m looking for anyone who has info on getting into this field, tips and tricks, setting up a resume, etc...
- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn and (now) here!

I'm hoping to use this space to post projects I've worked on, get inspired, and connect with other data obsessed people!
