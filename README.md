- 👋 Hi, I’m @LorrindaE!
- 👀 I’m interested in data, analyzing data, learning how to manipulate data... I've learned some Python, Tableau, Excel, Pandas, SQL...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Microsoft Power BI... and I just earned my **SixSigma Data Analytics Professional Certification!!**
- 💞️ I’m looking for anyone who has info on getting into this field, tips and tricks, setting up a resume, etc...
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorrinda-estabrook-a9aa35a/) and (now) here!

I'm hoping to use this space to post projects I've worked on, get inspired, and connect with other data obsessed people! To check out some of my work so far, check out my Projects folder-- I have a couple of different Excel dashboards in there so far _(one was with help from Alex the Analyst, another was one I did for a local business who wanted to look into their profit and expenses for the past couple of years-- that file was bigger, but for ND reasons I've made only the working page and dashboard available to view here... ;) )_
